## Project Description

The aim of this project is to combine crime data and apartment rental prices data in Toronto into a single database for analysis. Rental data was collected in 2018, and one 2018 crime data is used.

The crime data contains a list of various crimes reported that occured in apartment buildings and outside.   The apartment rental data shows the rental price for various apartments in Toronto. Both datasets contain data collected from various neighbourhoods in Toronto. The datasets will be merged on FSA.
